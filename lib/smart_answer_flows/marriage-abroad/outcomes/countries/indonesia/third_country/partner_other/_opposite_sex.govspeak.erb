##Prove you’re free to get married

You need to swear an affirmation or affidavit that says you’re legally allowed to get married.

Make an appointment to swear your affirmation or affidavit at the [embassy in Jakarta](https://www.consular-appointments.service.gov.uk/fco/#!/british-embassy-jakarta/oaths-affirmations-and-affidavits/slot_picker) or the [consulate in Bali](https://www.consular-appointments.service.gov.uk/fco/#!/british-consulate-bali/oaths-affirmations-and-affidavits/slot_picker).

This costs £50 per person.

##What happens next

After you’ve booked your appointment, a consular officer will contact you with information about the affirmation or affidavit process and what you’ll need to bring.

^Your partner must get an affirmation or affidavit as well.^

##Naturalisation of your partner if they move to the UK

Your partner can apply to [become a British citizen](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.
